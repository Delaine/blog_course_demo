<p>What are we building? We are building a personal site. A place where we can blog, share examples of our work, and have people contact us.
Who are we building it for? We are building it for ourselves, but also the community. Sharing what we are learning by blogging is a great way to learn for ourselves, but we teach others in the process. Show potential employers that we know what we are doing.
